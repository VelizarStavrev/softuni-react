# softuni-react
This site is my final project for the React.js course from Software University.
It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js for the Front-End.
It uses Node.js with Express and MongoDB with Mongoose for the Back-End.

The project is split into two folders - client and server.
In the client each component has its own folder. The folder contains a JS file, a CSS file and an assets folder if the component uses such.
If a code has to be repeated - a new reusable component is created during the project.
